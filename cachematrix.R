# makeCacheMatrix() is basically a function that stores a list of functions.
# x: a square invertible matrix (our assumption).
# makeCacheMatrix() returns: a list containing functions to:
#              i. set()   : set the matrix         
#             ii. get()   : get the matrix         
#            iii. setinv(): set the inverse matrix 
#             iv. getinv(): get the inverse matrix 
# Values stored in variables (i-iv) will be used to for cacheSolve() function computation.

        inverse <- NULL

  #setinv() assigns the inverse matrix to object 'inverse' without quotes in an
